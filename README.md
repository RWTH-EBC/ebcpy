# ebcpy

This **py**thon package aims to collect generic functions and classes commonly
used at the Institute of Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (**EBC**).

Key features are:

* Pre-/Postprocessing
* Conversion
* SimulationAPI
* Optimization
* Statistics Analyzer
* Logger
* Data Types (Interface for reoccurring classes in other packages)

# Installation
Basic knowlege about **git** and **python** are required to understand the following simple steps.  
We tested this with `cmd` on a *Windows* 10 machine.

Until this is not publically available, you have to install it via:
```
git clone https://git.rwth-aachen.de/EBC/EBC_all/Python/ebcpy
pip install -e ebcpy
```

# How to get started?
We recommend running our jupyter-notebook to be guided through a **helpful tutorial**.  
For this, run the following code:
```
# If jupyter is not already installed:
pip install jupyter
# Go into your ebcpy-folder (cd \path_to_\ebcpy) or change the path to tutorial.ipynb and run:
jupyter notebook ebcpy\examples\tutorial.ipynb
```
