# Installation
Until this is open source, you have to install it via:
```
git clone https://git.rwth-aachen.de/EBC/EBC_all/Python/ebcpy
pip install -e ebcpy
```
You may switch branches to `development` for newly available features.

# How to get started?
We recommend running our jupyter-notebook. For this, run the following code:
```
# If not jupyter is not already installed:
pip install jupyter
# Go into your ebcpy-folder (cd \path_to_\ebcpy) or change the path to tutorial.ipynb and run:
jupyter notebook ebcpy\examples\tutorial.ipynb
```
If you have any questions, please contact us or raise an issue.
