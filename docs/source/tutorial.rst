How to use ebcpy
=====================


Data types
----------

As the interfaces between the different packages are quite important, we will start with some
examples on how to setup the classes.

.. automodule:: ebcpy.examples.data_types_example
    :members:

Pre-processing
----------------
This module can has different use-cases. Typical use-cases are mentioned in the
documentation of the function.

All functions in the pre-processing module should have a doctest. We refer to the example
in this doctest for a better understanding of the functions. If you don't understand
the behaviour of a function or the meaning, please raise an issue.
